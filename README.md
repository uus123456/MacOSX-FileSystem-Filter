# MacOSX-FileSystem-Filter
A file system filter for Mac OS X

The license model is a BSD Open Source License. This is a non-viral license, only asking that if you use it, you acknowledge the authors, in this case Slava Imameev.

Mac OS X doesn't support a full fledged file system filtering like Windows as Apple believes that BSD stackable file system doesn't fit Mac OS X. The available kernel authorization subsystem ( kauth ) allows only filtering open requests and a limited number of operations on file/directory. It doesn't allow filtering read and write operations and provides a limited control over file system operations as a vnode is already created at the moment of kauth callback invoking. In Windows parlance a kauth callback is a postoperation callback for create/open request ( IRP_MJ_CREATE for Windows ), that is all you have for Mac OS X. Not much really.

 The filtering can also be implemented by registering MAC ( Mandatory Access Control ) layer. But MAC has limited functionality and not consistent in relation to file system filtering as it was not designed as a file system filter layer. Instead of being called by VFS layer MAC registered callbacks are scattered through the kernel code. They are called from system calls and other kernel subsystems, so MAC doesn't provide a consistent interface for VFS filter and if I remember correctly MAC was declared as deprecated for usage by third party developers.

  To summarize the above, there is no official support from Apple if you need to filter read or/and write requests, filter and modify VFS vnode operation.

The lack of a stackable file system support by Mac OS X VFS required to find a way to place a filter between VFS invoking vnode operations via VNOP_* functions and a file system driver implementing these vnode operations. I developed a hooking technique for VFS layer that emulates a stackable file system by replacing vnode operations in array. This technique allows to place a filter between VFS and file system driver and supports sophisticated filtering such as isolation file system filter when a filter creates vnodes instead of a file system driver thus gaining a full control over file data. I used this technique in two projects to implement filtering for lookup, create, read and write requests and to implement an isolation file system.

 FltFakeFSD.h and FltFakeFSD.cpp are optional files that helps to infer the vnode and vnodeop_desc structures layout that are not declared in SDK.  This is achieved by registering a dummy file system, creating a vnode and inspecting it to find required offsets. All you need to do is to call FltGetVnodeLayout() in a filter initialization code.

 Alternatively you can extract declarations from XNU code at opensource.apple.com. An alternative implementation without using the fake FSD can be found in VersionDependent.h and VersionDependent.cpp files, where struct vnodeop_desc_Yosemite was borrowed from Apple's open source code for Yosemite(10.10), it happened that vnode and vnodeop_desc structures haven't change in all latest kernel versions so this code works for Mavericks(10.9) and El Capitan(10.11).

 The filter registers a kauth callback FltIOKitKAuthVnodeGate::VnodeAuthorizeCallback which in turn calls FltHookVnodeVopAndParent that hooks vnode related operations. The kauth callback is used only to trigger filtering for a file system. When an application opens a file FileX in a directory DirX a vnode for a DirX is provided as a parameter for VnodeAuthorizeCallback so the following calls to file system's lookup or create operations for FileX will be visible for file system filter. When an original lookup or create returns a filter calls FltHookVnodeVopAndParent for a returned vnode or does this in a kauth callback which is nearly the same as kauth callback is a postoperation callback called after VNOP_LOOKUP or VNOP_CREATE. In case of lookup vnode operation do not forget about name cache, so lookup is not always called when an application calls open( FileX ), but if you need to see all lookup operations it is possible to disable name caching for a vnode. You can devise your own way of finding vnodes to hook depending on your requirements, for my purposes a kauth callback worked well as I was filtering vnodes of VREG type so I can use VDIR vnode as an anchor that started filtering for VREG vnodes. Also in most file systems vnode operations array is shared between all vnodes of VREG and VDIR type.

 The filter registers operations it wants to intercept in gFltVnodeVopHookEntries array. The skeleton filter immediately calls an original function from a hook but if you want to see a filter in action look at DldVNodeHook.cpp ( https://github.com/slavaim/MacOSX-Kernel-Filter/blob/master/DLDriver/DldVNodeHook.cpp ) which is a more advanced implementation at MacOSX-Kernel-Filter that also implements an isolation filter for read and write operations on a file by redirecting read and write to a sparse file on another volume. The isolation filter is implemented at DldCoveringVnode.cpp and a sparse file at DldSparseFile.cpp
